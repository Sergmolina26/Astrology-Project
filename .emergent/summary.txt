The AI engineer progressed Celestia from initial feature requests to a functional full-stack application. Key phases included backend email/payment integration, frontend internationalization, and robust admin role management. Initially, SendGrid was implemented for emails, but later abstracted to a generic SMTP service for provider flexibility (e.g., Brevo, Mailgun) due to SendGrid 403 errors and user preference. Extensive debugging fixed critical login (502, ) and UI rendering (, JSON syntax) errors. Admin dashboard statistics and user management were made functional, alongside a client/Mistica's notes system. Most recently, the focus shifted to the booking system, addressing no reader available errors, incorrect session durations (60 minutes appearing as 6 hours), business hour constraints, and initiating Google Calendar/Meets integration, with a payment-first booking workflow.

Celestia is a web app for astrology birth-chart readings and tarot spreads with a secure client portal. It supports Admin, Reader, and Client roles with email/password authentication. Core features include capturing birth data for natal charts using Kerykeion, a transformed tarot booking system (removed self-serve), a client portal for session management, scheduling with Google Calendar/Meets sync, Stripe payments (initial via links, full integration pending), content library, notes/attachments, security, internationalization (English/Spanish), and analytics.
Current implementation includes functional client authentication, astrology chart generation, service booking, basic navigation, a user profile page, robust error handling, a blue/purple UI theme, English/Spanish language switching across most components, and backend updates for confirmation emails, payment links, and reader registration. The system now supports admin user roles with a dashboard for managing clients and notes.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several critical issues related to the service booking system, as reported by the user:

1.  **No reader available error**: The system was failing to find an available reader when a client attempted to book a session, likely because the admin user (who acts as the reader) was not explicitly marked with the reader role or the booking logic didn't account for admin roles as readers.
2.  **Incorrect session duration calculation**: A 60-minute service was incorrectly showing a booking duration of 6 hours (e.g., 10 AM to 4 PM).
3.  **Business hours constraints**: The user requested that bookings should only be available from 10 AM to 6 PM, Monday through Friday, with all sessions concluding by 6 PM.
4.  **Google Calendar & Google Meets integration**: The user emphasized the need to sync with their Google Calendar to prevent double bookings and integrate Google Meets for live sessions.
5.  **Payment-first workflow**: Bookings should only be auto-confirmed after payment is processed, followed by an email confirmation.

The engineer's immediate action was to investigate the no reader available error by examining the  file, specifically the session creation route and the  function. The last action in the trajectory was to begin fixing the no reader available error and duration calculation after a request for Google Calendar integration playbook.
