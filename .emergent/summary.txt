The AI engineer successfully built the Celestia application from an initial description, iteratively adding features and fixing bugs based on user feedback. Key accomplishments include setting up a FastAPI backend with MongoDB, a React frontend using Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS, and integrating the Kerykeion library for astrology calculations. The development progressed through initial UI creation, fixing form interaction issues, refining user roles, implementing Google Maps for geolocation (later reverted due to issues), robust error handling, and extensive UI/UX theming based on user preferences. Most recently, the engineer focused on integrating email confirmation via SendGrid, adding payment links, and setting up reader registration and notifications, which is currently in progress. The process involved multiple rounds of debugging React runtime errors and refining backend data handling for astrological inputs.

The goal is to build Celestia, a web app for astrology birth-chart readings and tarot spreads, featuring a secure client portal.
**Core Functionality:**
1.  **Users & Roles:** Admin, Reader, Client with email/password and OAuth (Google/Apple) authentication. Multi-tenancy for Readers, clients belong to one Reader. Timezone handling (UTC storage, user TZ display).
2.  **Astrology:** Capture birth data (name, date, time, place, lat/long), compute natal chart (planets, houses, aspects), generate chart wheel image/tabular data, interpretations, PDF export. Initial request was for AI to generate chart, user interprets.
3.  **Tarot:** Tarot deck model, configurable spreads (1-card, 3-card, Celtic Cross, Custom), random draw with seed, card images/meanings, Reader notes, save snapshots, PDF export. User later clarified to remove self-serve tarot, focusing on Reader-provided services.
4.  **Client Portal:** Clients view past/upcoming sessions in calendar, access session details (charts, spreads, notes, attachments, invoices), download notes, request follow-ups, reschedule.
5.  **Scheduling:** Booking page per Reader with service types, buffers, Google Calendar sync (two-way), email/SMS reminders. Integrate Google Meets for live sessions.
6.  **Payments:** Stripe integration for one-time payments, coupon codes, invoices/receipts, payment status on session. Initial request was for payment links in emails for booked services.
7.  **Content Library:** Editable text blocks for interpretations, merge fields.
8.  **Notes & Files:** Rich text notes (private/client-visible), attachments (PDF, images, audio), virus scan.
9.  **Security & Privacy:** Role-based access control, encryption for notes/birth data, audit logs, GDPR-style data management.
10. **Internationalization:** English primary, Spanish secondary (i18n keys).
11. **Analytics:** Dashboard for Admin/Reader (sessions, revenue, services, retention, show/cancel rates).

**Current Implementation Details:**
*   Authentication is functional with client-only registration.
*   Astrology birth chart generation is implemented using the Kerykeion library, with location input and coordinate conversion handled.
*   Tarot functionality transformed from self-serve to a service booking system.
*   Basic navigation and a user profile page are in place.
*   Error handling for React runtime errors is robust.
*   UI/UX features a blue/purple gradient theme with brush gold accents, mystical decorative elements, celestial animations, and Cinzel font.
*   English/Spanish language switching is implemented site-wide.
*   Backend is being updated to send confirmation emails with payment links and register the user as a Reader for notifications.

Handles API routes for authentication, user management, birth data, astrology charts, service booking, and now email/payment integration, and reader registration. This file has been extensively modified multiple times to add new routes, integrate Kerykeion, manage errors, and recently to include email, payment, and reader functionalities.
-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**: Lists Python dependencies.  and  were added.
-   **/app/backend/.env**: Stores backend environment variables like  and .  was added during initial setup.
-   **/app/backend/utils/email.py**: New file to handle sending emails, specifically for session confirmations and payment links.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's requests regarding email confirmation for service requests, payment collection, and the ability to register as a Reader to receive notifications about clients and sessions.

The engineer:
1.  **Installed **: After an initial attempt to install  failed,  was successfully installed in the backend requirements.
2.  **Modified **:
    *   Added logic for email functionality.
    *   Included code paths for generating payment links (though full Stripe integration is pending).
    *   Introduced mechanisms for reader management and notifications.
    *   Updated the session creation route to trigger email notifications and include payment links.
    *   Added a new route to allow explicit registration as a 'reader' to receive notifications.
    *   Restored a previously missing  route, essential for user information retrieval.
3.  **Created new backend model files**:
    *   
    *    (enhanced)
4.  **Created new backend utility files**:
    *   
    *   

The current state is that the backend has been updated to support these features, but the integration of these new backend functionalities with the frontend, and thorough testing of the email sending and reader notification mechanisms, are still pending. The  route was the very last modification in the trajectory.
