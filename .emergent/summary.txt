<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully transformed Celestia from an MVP, addressing numerous critical issues and implementing new features. Initial efforts focused on fixing core booking system bugs: incorrect session duration (60 minutes showing as 6 hours), no reader available errors, and business hour constraints. This involved refactoring backend logic () and updating frontend service definitions. Subsequently, the focus shifted to fixing pervasive time display discrepancies in the UI, enabling interactive dashboard statistics, restoring session detail dialogs, and ensuring notes visibility. The final major feature was integrating KerykeionChartSVG for inline astrological map generation, which was implemented on the backend and partially on the frontend. A recurring theme was debugging frontend display issues, often linked to  inconsistencies or authentication blocking UI testing, leading to a need for manual verification at the end of the trajectory.

<product_requirements>
Celestia is a web app for astrology birth-chart readings and tarot spreads, featuring a secure client portal with Admin, Reader, and Client roles. Core functionalities include capturing birth data for natal charts using Kerykeion, a transformed tarot booking system with Google Calendar/Meets sync (pending), Stripe payments (full integration pending), content library, notes, attachments, security, and internationalization (English/Spanish). The current implementation supports client authentication, astrology chart generation, service booking, a user profile, robust error handling, a blue/purple UI, and language switching. Recent work added admin user roles, dashboard management for clients and notes, updated service offerings (General or Purpose Reading, Astrological Tarot Session), fixed booking duration and business hours, resolved session display discrepancies, made dashboard stats clickable, restored session detail dialogs, and integrated inline astrological map generation.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on displaying the astrological map generated by Kerykeion directly within the frontend. The backend  was successfully updated to generate and store  content using . The  model in the backend was also updated to include fields for this SVG data. On the frontend,  was modified to include Generate Map and View Map buttons and to render the SVG content inline below the birth chart. Despite backend functionality being confirmed, the frontend display of the map was not working, and testing efforts were continually blocked by authentication issues preventing proper UI interaction and validation. The user confirmed the map display was still not working and requested it to be inline.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and resolve the frontend authentication issue to enable proper testing and verification of the inline astrological map display.
